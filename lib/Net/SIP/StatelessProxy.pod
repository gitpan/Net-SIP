Net::SIP::StatelessProxy - Simple implementation of a stateless proxy

=head1 SYNOPSIS

..

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package implements a simple stateless SIP proxy.
Basic idea is that the proxy has either a single or two legs
and that the packets are exchanged between those legs,
e.g. packets incoming on one leg will be forwarded through the
other leg.

Because this is a stateless proxy no retransmits will be done
by the proxy.

The proxy can be used in connection with L<Net::SIP::Registrar>
to work as a registrar too. In this case incoming packets from
the dispatcher need to be forwarded to the registrar and only
if the registrar does not handle the packet (method B<receive>
in L<Net::SIP::Registrar> returns C<()> ) it should be handled
by the proxy.

While forwarding the proxy will be insert itself into the packet,
e.g. it will add B<Via> and B<Record-Route> header while
forwarding requests.

Additionally it will rewrite the B<Contact> header while forwarding
packets, e.g. if the B<Contact> header points to some client
it will rewrite it, so that it points to the proxy and if it
already points to the proxy it will rewrite it back so that it again
points to the client.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=over 4

=item new ( %ARGS )

Creates a new stateless proxy. With %ARGS the behavior can be
influenced:

=over 8

=item dispatcher

The L<Net::SIP::Dispatcher> object managing the proxy.

=item registrar

This is either a hash reference which can be used in the constructor
of L<Net::SIP::Registrar> or a registrar object itself (only criteria
is that it needs to have a method B<receive> with the behavior
described for L<Net::SIP::Registrar>).

If given all incoming REGISTER requests will be forwarded to the
registrar (by calling it's method B<receive>) and only if the
registrar does not handle the packet (method returns C<()>) it will
be handled by the proxy.

=item rewrite_contact

Callback which is used in rewriting B<Contact> headers.
If one puts user@host in it should rewrite it and if one puts
something without '@' it should try to rewrite it back
(and return B<()> if it cannot rewrite it back).
A working default implementation is provided.

=item nathelper

Optional Net::SIP::NATHelper::* object. When given it will be
used to do NAT, e.g. if the incoming and outgoing legs are different
it will rewrite the SDP bodies to use local sockets and the nathelper
will transfer the RTP data between the local and the original
sockets.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item receive ( PACKET, LEG, FROM )

PACKET is the incoming packet,
LEG is the L<Net::SIP::Leg> where the packet arrived and FROM
is the C<< "ip:port" >> of the sender.

Called from the dispatcher on incoming packets. The packet
will be rewritten (C<Via> and C<Record-Route> headers added,
B<Contact> modified) and then the packet will be forwarded.

For requests it can determine the target of the forwarded
packet by looking at the route or if no route it looks at
the URI. For responses it looks at the next B<Via> header.

=item do_nat ( PACKET, INCOMING_LEG, OUTGOING_LEG )

This will be called from B<receive> while forwarding data.
If B<nathelper> is defined it will be used to rewrite SDP bodies
and update nathelpers internal states to forward RTP data.

Return values are like B<forward_outgoing> in L<Net::SIP::Leg>, e.g.
it will return C<< [code,text] >> on error or C<()> on success,
where success can be that the packet was rewritten or that there
was no need to touch it.
