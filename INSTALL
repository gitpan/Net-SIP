This module can be installed on perl5.8 if you add Net::DNS.

It was not tested on older versions but it might work if you add
Storable, List::Util, Hash::Util, Time::HiRes, Digest::MD5
and IO::Socket.

The module itself is pure perl, so if the prerequisites are
fullfilled no C-Compiler is necessary.

For installation do the usual

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
